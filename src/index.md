Hey, I’m ldstephens. This domain isn’t my first; I’ve been writing online since the late 1990s, and I can’t count how many times I’ve pulled the plug on previous blogs.

For now, this is my little corner of the web where I share whatever’s on my mind: stories, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. You’ll also find quotes that resonate with me and links I believe are worth sharing. Nothing fancy, just the small but meaningful stuff from my day-to-day life.

Anyway, I have no clue where this thing is going. Could be great, could be a mess. Either way, stick around. Or don’t. It’s your call.
