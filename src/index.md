Hey there! I'm ldstephens, and welcome to my weblog, the unfiltered, non-techy side of me. This is where I ramble about life, current events, blogging, random thoughts, and whatever else I feel like throwing into the void.

I also run a [tech blog](https://ldstephens.net), where I mostly geek out over Apple stuff: tips, tricks, automation, and all that nerdy stuff. Been at it since 2016.

So why the hell did I start this weblog? Because sometimes I want to write about things that have nothing to do with tech. And honestly, my tech blog audience didn't sign up for my hot takes, personal stories, or my occasional rant about the state of the world.

Anyway, I have no clue where this thing is going. Could be great, could be mess. Either way, stick around. Or don't. It's your call.
