Welcome to my weblog. I’m Loren and I'm trying something new here. 

This site is where I write about life, blogging, current events, tech, or anything else that grabs my attention. It started last July on Pika and bounced around for a while while I figured out if I even wanted to use it. Eventually, I rebuilt it with 11ty, and this time, I’m sticking with it.

According to the server stats, no one’s showing up yet. I get it. It’s new. It’ll take time for people to find it. I’m hoping the site grows the old-school way: someone reads a post, likes it, and links to it. That’s how this kind of writing spreads. In the end, this space is for me. I’m here to write what I want, when I want. People will find it or they won’t. Either way, I’m good.
