Welcome to my weblog I’m Loren.

I’m trying something new here. I started this blog in July 2024 as a side project to my main blog, [ldstephens](https://ldstephens.net), which I’ve been writing since 2016. That one’s mostly about tech, but lately, I haven’t had much tech to write about. So, I wanted a place where I could be comfortable writing about whatever the hell I want. That’s why I started lstep.xyz. It’s meant to be a space for thoughts and opinions on life, tech, current events, blogging, and whatever else crosses my mind. It started its life on [Pika](https://pika.page/) and went back and forth a few times, mostly because I wasn’t sure I’d stick with it.

But here we are. I rebuilt it with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and I’m committed to keeping it going this time. According to the server stats, no one’s showing up yet. I get it. It’s new. It’ll take time for people to find it. I’m hoping the site grows the old-school way: someone reads a post, likes it, and links to it. That’s how this kind of writing spreads. In the end, this space is for me. I’m here to write what I want, when I want. People will find it or they won’t. Either way, I’m good.
