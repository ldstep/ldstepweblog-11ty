Welcome to my weblog I’m Loren.

I’m trying something new here. I started this site in July 2024 because my main blog, [ldstephens](https://ldstephens.net/), running since 2016, is about tech. Truth is, I just don’t have enough tech shit to write about these days. And I needed somewhere to just spill whatever the hell is on my mind. That’s what lstep.xyz is for: my thoughts on life, tech, current events, blogging, and random crap that interests me.

lstep bounced around on [Pika](https://pika.page/) for a bit, I wasn’t sure if I’d stick with it. But fuck it, I rebuilt everything with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and I’m actually committed this time. Server stats say nobody’s showing up yet. I get it. It’ll take time. Maybe someone reads something, likes it, shares it, that old-school internet way. But honestly? This is for me. I’ll write what I want, when I want. People will find it or they won’t. Either way, I’m good.
