## Colophon

This blog is built using static [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys when I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/lstep).

The domain is registered through [Hover](https://hover.com/).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and copied as HTML to add to a new post in VS Code.
