  Hey, I&#8217;m ldstephens. This domain isn&#8217;t my first; I&#8217;ve been
  writing online since the late 1990s, and I can&#8217;t count how many times
  I&#8217;ve pulled the plug on previous blogs. For now, this is my little
  corner of the web where I share whatever&#8217;s on my mind: stories, random
  thoughts, and the occasional rant.
</p>
<p>
  You&#8217;ll also find quotes that resonate with me and links I believe are
  worth sharing. Nothing fancy, just the small but meaningful stuff from my
  day-to-day life. Anyway, I have no clue where this thing is going.
</p>
<p>
  Could be great, could be a mess. Either way, stick around. Or don&#8217;t.
  It&#8217;s your call.
</p>
