> I’m so sick of hyper-specialized, narrowly focused web presence. Give me weird. Give me personal. Talk about more than just “your focus.” I want to hear about music and art and what you’re reading and your hobbies and travels. Show me the real you. Make the web weird again!

lstephens has always been pretty narrowly focused on tech and Apple stuff. That's exactly why I started this weblog - as a place where I can freely post about everything else. It’s my weird web, and I don't want to bore my tech followers with personal stories, random thoughts, the occasional rant, or whatever else I'm into that has nothing to do with tech.
