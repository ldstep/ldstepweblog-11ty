I've got this old blog over on [WordPress.com](https://ldstephens.net) that I don't post to anymore, but people still check it out. When it was time to renew the subscription, I just went with the free version. Now, every time you go there, there's a banner on the header of every page telling me to upgrade, and tons of fucking ads. It looks like shit.

Anyway, the other day I found this article about [migrating blogs from WordPress to Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/migrate/wordpress/). This blog is built with 11ty. So, I'm trying to move the WordPress blog over to Eleventy. If it works out, Iâ€™ll deploy it on Netlify or Vercel.
