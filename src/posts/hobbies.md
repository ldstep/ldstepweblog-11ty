One of my favorite hobbies is exploring different text editors. They typically fall into two categories: simple and ready-to-use, or deep and endlessly customizable, provided you invest the time.

Editors like iA Writer and MarkEdit are user-friendly and come with most of the essential features built-in. In contrast, Drafts, VS Code, BBEdit, and Sublime Text offer extensive customization options, but require a willingness to learn.

Drafts is my go-to editor because I've used it for years and have customized it to suit my preferences. When I need a more focused writing environment, I use iA Writer. I use VS Code to manage my 11ty sites.
