It's been in the 30s the last few mornings here in central New Jersey. We're close to peak fall color. This afternoon I'm going to mow the grass for what will be the last time until next spring. Of course, I use it along with the leaf blower to clean up all the leaves that are starting to fall.

2:37:51 PM

I mowed the entire lawn, and the last thing was the trail that goes around the property. Unfortunately, the transmission belt on my Cub Cadet ZT1 zero-turn mower broke about a quarter mile back in the woods. Shit!

Now I’ll have to tow it out and get it fixed, as it doesn’t look like a repair I can handle myself.
