Yesterday I installed the 11ty RSS plugin. This is my first since installing it so if you get this post in your RSS feed then it’s working.

It’s a cold morning in New Jersey 20° with a wind chill of 18°. Not supposed to get out of the 20’s all day. Looks like we’ll be confined indoors all day so I’ll work on building my other blog in 11ty.
