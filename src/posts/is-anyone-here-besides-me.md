April 23, 2025

I’m trying something new here. I started this blog in July last year as a side project to my main blog, [ldstephens](https://ldstephens.net), which I’ve been writing since 2016. That one’s mostly about tech, but lately, I haven’t had much tech to write about. So, I wanted a place where I could be comfortable writing about whatever the hell I want.

That’s why I started **lstep.xyz**. It’s meant to be a space for thoughts and opinions on life, tech, current events, blogging, and whatever else crosses my mind. It started its life on [Pika](https://pika.page/) and went back and forth a few times, mostly because I wasn’t sure I’d stick with it.

But here we are. I rebuilt it with 11ty, and I’m committed to keeping it going this time.

Still, where the fuck is everybody?

According to the server stats, no one’s showing up. I get it. It’s new. It’ll take time for people to find it.

Today, I was thinking about how to get more exposure. But **not** through social media. I’m counting on the site growing the old school way, someone reads a post, likes it, and links to it. That’s how this kind of writing spreads.

In the end, this space is for me. I’m here to write what I want, when I want. People will find it or they won’t. Either way, I’m good.
