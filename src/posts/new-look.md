I’ve been tinkering with the site’s design and layout the last couple of days. The new color scheme is my take on [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) (the theme, not the vampire), and navigation has moved to the footer. I like this version better since it’s mine, unlike the old [11ty-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) setup.
