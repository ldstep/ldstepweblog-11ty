About every two weeks, I make a run to Tractor Supply for 150 pounds of cracked corn and 80 pounds of birdseed, and today was that day. We put corn out twice a day for the deer and wild turkeys, and keep the feeders full for all the birds passing through.

Of course, the squirrels and raccoons think it's their personal buffet. They climb the trees, dump the feeders, and act innocent when you catch them in the act. Still, we wouldn't trade it. Watching all the wildlife roam our property is half the fun.
