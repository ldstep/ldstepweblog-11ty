I updated the design of this site today. It’s simpler, faster, and easier to read.

The new look sticks to a clean black-and-white theme that automatically switches to dark mode if your device prefers it. Links are always underlined for clarity, and system fonts keep everything feeling native and quick.

Just a small refresh — focused on readability and comfort.
