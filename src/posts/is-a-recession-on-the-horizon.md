Hey friends, the [April 14th episode](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/on-with-kara-swisher) of On with Kara Swisher got me thinking about the possibility that weâ€™re headed for recession. Her guests didn't mince words: if we keep heading down the path of trade wars, Fed fights, and zero fiscal discipline, we're likely in for a recession later this year. One even said it comes down to the decisions of one person -- and we all know who that is.

Economists and banks are sounding the alarm. [Goldman Sachs just raised the odds of a recession to 45%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-raises-odds-us-recession-45-2025-04-07/). [JPMorgan predicts a downturn in the second half of 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-becomes-the-first-wall-street-bank-to-forecast-a-us-recession-following-trumps-tariffs-222019272.html). [Ray Dalio warns it could be worse than a recession](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ray-dalio-says-trumps-trade-war-could-spark-something-worse-than-a-recession-3774ceef). The [Conference Board's index is falling](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators), and [market volatility](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/is-a-recession-coming-2025/) is back in the spotlight.

A recession is basically the economy slamming the brakes. Spending drops, businesses earn less, people lose jobs or hours -- and it spirals. Everyone pulls back and waits it out. It's all connected, and it all slows down.

So what can we do? Trim non-essential spending. Build up a bit of savings if possible. Hold off on taking on new debt. If you've got a job, try to keep it even if it's not perfect.
