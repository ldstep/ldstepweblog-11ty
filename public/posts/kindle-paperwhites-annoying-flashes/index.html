<p>I have a 10th generation Kindle Paperwhite. I've read from it a fair amount, particularly when I was away, because it's so light. But I generally don't care for the experience. It's very slow, and whenever I turn a page I get this annoying flash as the screen goes through this inversion process from whatever mode I'm in until it settles on either the Dark or Light Mode, which I selected. That is, if I'm in Light Mode, the page will first appear in Dark Mode, then switch to Light Mode. If I'm in Dark Mode and turn the page, the page first appears in Light Mode, then switches to dark. Very annoying.</p>

<p>I also have a Paperwhite that I use for reading, and while I appreciate its lightweight, I’m not a huge fan of the overall experience either. I continue to use it because it’s so lightweight. I have an iPad, but it’s simply too heavy for comfortable reading.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m actually reading a physical book for the first time in a very long time, and I’m enjoying the experience.</p>
