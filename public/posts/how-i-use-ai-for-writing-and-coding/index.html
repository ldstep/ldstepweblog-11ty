    <p>Posted on February 6, 2025 by Loren</p>
<p>I’ve been using AI in two ways: for help with my writing and for figuring out how to do things.</p>
<p>My writing skills aren’t that great. I know what I want to say and how I want to say it, but I struggle to put it into words. So, I use AI to proofread and improve the structure of what I’ve written.</p>
<p>The other way AI helps me is with writing HTML and CSS for my static blog projects. I use it to explain things in HTML or CSS and to offer the code. For example, yesterday, I had a couple of posts where I kept getting an error in my HTML, and I couldn’t figure out what was wrong. So, I copied the code and put it into Claude. It rewrote the code and explained what it fixed. I guess you could call that debugging my code.</p>
<p>AI has become a valuable tool for me. Whether it’s helping me improve my writing or troubleshooting code, it saves me time and makes things easier.</p>
